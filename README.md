# Install / Running

1. Make sure you have node.js installed. I'm using node 21 (you can manage versions using node version manager)
2. Install dependencies with `npm i` in the project directory
3. Start the development server `npm run dev`

# Highlights

- Routing using react-router
- State management with react-redux / redux toolkit
  - Uses best-practices for data fetching using async thunks
  - Loading, error states implemented
- Lazy-loading dog images in carousel
- Using UI framework 'Mantine' for speed of development without sacrificing accessibility etc.
